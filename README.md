# Utopia-NASA-API
Our team developed a near-future travel agency site for intergalactic excursions. I provided JASON and AJAX calls to NASA databases for asteroid data and astronomical photos.

## NASA Near Earth Object Web Team (NEOWT) database call
Visit Travel Tips & Safety > Asteroid Watch to view the near earth objects called from NASA's NEOWT database.

JavaScript and JQuery is used to plot asteroids for a given date by distance, speed, size, and hazardous status.


## NASA APOD call with AJAX
See Upcoming Destinations to view an AJAX call to NASA's APOD database; the API retrieves the astronomical picture of the day; title and description data are also pulled from the database and are displayed as overlays using CSS4.
